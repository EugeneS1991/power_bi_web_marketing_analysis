- **Objective:** Track repeat purchase frequency and activity trends by cohort

**2. Cohort by Revenue:**
- **Rows:** Month of user's first transaction
- **Columns:** Subsequent months after the first transaction
- **Values:** Total revenue generated by the cohort in each month

**3. Cohort by Retention Rate:**
- **Rows:** Month of user's first session
- **Columns:** Subsequent months after the first session
- **Values:** Percentage of users from the cohort who returned in each month
- **Objective:** Measure retention and identify user retention issues

## 🔧 Data Generation

To generate mock data for the dashboard, use the provided Python script:

```bash
python generate_mock_data.py --start-date 2025-01-01 --months 6
```

### Script Options:
- `--start-date` - Start date in YYYY-MM-DD format (default: 2025-01-01)
- `--months` - Number of months to generate (default: 6)
- `--output-dir` - Output directory for CSV files (default: ./data)
- `--users` - Number of unique users in pool (default: 50000)

### Example:
```bash
# Generate 6 months of data starting from January 2025
python generate_mock_data.py --start-date 2025-01-01 --months 6

# Generate 12 months of data starting from January 2024
python generate_mock_data.py --start-date 2024-01-01 --months 12
```
